In the 18th and 19th of January 2025, I participated in my first Hackathon, [HackaPizza](https://hackathon.datapizza.com/), organized by the amazing team of [DataPizza](https://www.datapizza.tech/). It was a 24-hours event, held in Milan, Italy, in a very iconic and fascinating location: the IBM Studios, in Piazza Gae Aulenti.

I was part of the team `4-omini` (very bad Italian joke), composed by me, Cristian, Andrea and Alessandro. There were 20 teams participating, each composed of 3 or 4 members, that had been chosen by the organizers among more than 600 applicants. We knew that the bar was high, but we were ready to give our best.
