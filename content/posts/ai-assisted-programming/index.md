Recent weeks were characterized by a proliferation of discussions about AI and how it can be used to assist developers in their job. The matter is not only about using it as a code support tool, but more like as having an experienced programmer at your disposal, that you can leverage to design your project, debug it, even writing all the code for you. A new term was even coined to describe this new pattern, *vibecoding*, that now even has its own [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding).

We need to clarify one matter: there is a *huge* difference between using AI to assist you in your job and perform *vibecoding*. It's not about one being good and the other bad, but it's about understanding the implications of each choice and the contexts in which you can use one or another. Obviously, you can vibecode your weekend project, but you wouldn't want to do the same for the critical software that runs your company (and gives you your paycheck). This was very well explained by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), in this [blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/), whose claims I fully support.

I'm not sure how to feel about vibecoding and . As I always do, I tried to gather some reflections on the matter by people that I find insightful. Just to give you some examples

- [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383), who coined the term *vibecoding*, is indeed optimistic about this trend. Actually, he had been claiming since [last year](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1617979122625712128) that "the new hottest programming language is English" (even though it was written with a slightly different meaning in mind).
- The already mentioned Simon Willinson wrote a [blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/) where he explains how he uses LLMs to write code.
