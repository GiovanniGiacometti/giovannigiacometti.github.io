I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [ML cube](https://www.mlcube.com/home-it/), a [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) spin-off, where I'm involved in the development of the [ML cube Platform](https://ml-cube.github.io/ml3-platform-docs/), an MLOps platform that offers data and model monitoring, drift explainability and performance-safe retraining.

I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Politecnico di Milano and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Università Politecnica delle Marche](https://www.univpm.it/). During the second year of the Master, I had the opportunity to spend a semester at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/) as an Erasmus student, which was an incredibly enriching experience.

I enjoy building things, both related to AI and not. I like sharing things I know and learning from others. I love the feeling of being able to transform ideas into reality. I also believe that as developers we have to do our job responibly.

Other random things about me:

- In January 2025, I participated in the [DataPizza Hackathon](https://hackathon.datapizza.com/) and I was part of the team that got the 2nd place.

- In November 2024, I obtained the [Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/machine-learning-engineer) certification.

- I've played football for 15 years, now I'm preparing my first Marathon (let's connect on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/62103058) if you want).
